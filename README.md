# Maccoland
Maccoland is a feature packed mod server for Galcon with over 10 new game modes and some really nasty features for power hungry super admins. Most famously the birthplace of KotH, Race, Football and Zap mode. 

**How do I host this server?**
1. Click the green button in the top right corner and then click on "Download Zip" to start the download.
1. Put the whole maccoland folder in the "Resources" folder of Galcon.
2. Go to the Galcon main menu and click the "MODS" button.
3. Enter the path to the file mod_server.lua in the maccoland folder.
4. Click play.


**Why is no one joining my server?**

You need to port forward the port 23099 on your router so that people are able to join.

You can edit the config.lua file to customize your server.  
Type /help in the chat to see all the commands that you can use.

**How can I make my own game mode?**

I recommend that you get help in the [Galcon modding forums](https://www.galcon.com/forums/55/65/). The code is a _complete mess_, but still some people have managed to add their own game modes.
