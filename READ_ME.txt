== WELCOME ==
Hi there, thanks for downloading Maccoland. 


== HOW TO ==
How do I host this server?
1. Put the whole maccoland folder in the "Resources" folder of Galcon.
2. Go to the Galcon main menu and click the "MODS" button.
3. Enter the path to the file mod_server.lua in the maccoland folder.
4. Click play.

Why is no one joining my server?
You need to port forward the port 23099 on your router so that people are able to join.
You can google "port forwarding tutorial" if you don't know how to do that.
